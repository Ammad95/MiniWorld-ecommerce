# 📢 Communications Feature Setup Guide

## Overview
The Communications feature allows administrators to create and manage dynamic announcements that are displayed at the top of the website, replacing the hardcoded "Free shipping on orders over $100 | New arrivals weekly" text.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor

2. **Run the Announcements Schema**
   - Copy the contents of `ANNOUNCEMENTS-SCHEMA.sql`
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

3. **Verify Table Creation**
   - Go to Table Editor
   - Confirm `announcements` table exists with these columns:
     - `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
     - `title` (VARCHAR)
     - `content` (TEXT)
     - `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
     - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
     - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
     - `created_by` (UUID, Foreign Key)

### Step 2: Access the Communications Panel
1. **Login to Admin Portal**
   - Go to `/admin/login`
   - Login with your admin credentials

2. **Navigate to Communications**
   - In the admin sidebar, click "Communications"
   - You'll see the announcements management interface

## 📝 Using the Communications Feature

### Creating Announcements
1. **Click "Create Announcement"**
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Title**: Internal name for the announcement (not shown on website)
   - **Content**: The text that will be displayed on the website
   - **Active**: Check to make it visible on the website

3. **Click "Create Announcement"**

### Managing Announcements
- **Edit**: Click the edit (pencil) icon to modify an announcement
- **Toggle Visibility**: Click the eye icon to show/hide announcements
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to permanently remove announcements

### Best Practices
1. **Keep Content Short**: Announcements appear in a banner, so keep text concise
2. **Use Emojis**: Add visual appeal with relevant emojis (✨, 🎉, 🚚, etc.)
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep announcements fresh and relevant
4. **Test Visibility**: Always check the website after creating/editing announcements

## 🎯 Features

### Dynamic Display
- **Auto-rotation**: If multiple active announcements exist, they rotate every 8 seconds
- **Smooth Transitions**: Announcements fade in/out with animation
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes appear immediately on the website
- **Fallback**: If database is unavailable, shows default text

### Admin Management
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete announcements
- **Status Management**: Easily enable/disable announcements
- **Timestamp Tracking**: See when announcements were created/updated
- **Responsive Interface**: Works on all device sizes

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
```

### Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled for data protection
- **Admin-only Write Access**: Only authenticated admins can modify announcements
- **Public Read Access**: Website visitors can view active announcements
- **Input Validation**: All forms validate required fields

### Performance
- **Indexed Queries**: Optimized database queries for fast loading
- **Caching**: Frontend caches announcements to reduce database calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Announcements load asynchronously

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Announcements not showing on website**
- ✅ Check if announcement is marked as "Active"
