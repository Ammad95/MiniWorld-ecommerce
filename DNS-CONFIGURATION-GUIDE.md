# DNS Configuration Guide for miniworldpk.com

## üö® Current Issue
Domain `miniworldpk.com` is not resolving (DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error).

## ‚úÖ Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Get Netlify Nameservers:**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to: **Domain management** ‚Üí **DNS**
   - Copy the 4 nameservers (e.g., `dns1.p03.nsone.net`)

2. **Update Domain Registrar:**
   - Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
   - Find "DNS" or "Nameservers" settings
   - Replace existing nameservers with Netlify's nameservers
   - Save changes

3. **Wait for Propagation:**
   - DNS changes take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
   - Usually works within 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Manual DNS Records (Advanced)

If you want to keep your current DNS provider:

**Add these records to your DNS settings:**

| Type  | Name | Value                              | TTL  |
|-------|------|------------------------------------|------|
| A     | @    | 75.2.60.5                         | 3600 |
| CNAME | www  | clear-faun-c16c4c.netlify.app     | 3600 |

### Option 3: Check Current Netlify Domain Settings

1. **Verify Domain in Netlify:**
   - Go to **Domain management**
   - Ensure `miniworldpk.com` is added as primary domain
   - Check if verification is complete
